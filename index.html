        <p> I chose Soccer because.Soccer is (known in many countries as football) is one of the world's most popular sports. It is a sport that combines speed, strength, and skill. Two teams, each with 11 players, play on a rectangular field and attempt to score by kicking or “heading” a ball into the opposing team's goal.No one knows exactly when soccer was created, but the earliest versions of the game can be traced back 3,000 years.
            Soccer is the most popular game in the world. ...
            In England, soccer was formed when several clubs formed the Football Association about 150 years ago.dentified by the name “soccer” in the U.S. and “football” elsewhere, the sport's original name is actually “basket-ball.” When the game was first created, the first were overturned wicker baskets.
            Soccer was played by prisoners at London's Newgate Prison in the early 1800s. ...
            A traditional soccer ball has 32 panels.
